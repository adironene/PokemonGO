# Lucky Trade List

> Welcome. I am glad that we hit Lucky Friends and look forward to making a lucky trade with you. Listed below is a list of pokemon I would like for lucky trades. Each row has 6 categories: image of the wanted Pokemon, name of the pokemon, pokedex #, wether or not I have it dexed, desired legacy movesets, and additional notes. My list is divided into 4 categories. Within each list, I have listed my most preferred choice to least preferred choice in ascending order. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me and ask.

## List 1 - Legendary Pokemon

My order of preference is as follows `Shiny with Aeroblast` > `Shiny w/o Legacy` > `Regular with Aeroblast` > `Regular w/o`                                                                |
| ![image](image/shiny_hooh.png)     | Shiny Ho-oh    | #250      | True             | Sacred Fire / Earthquake | I will only be taking the shiny variation of this Pokémon. I am not interested in the regular form. I prefer `Shiny Ho-oh with Earthquake` > `Shiny Ho-oh with Sacred` > `Shiny Ho-oh w/o Legacy`                                                                           |

## List 2 - Non-Legendary Pokemon

- I will take the different evolution stage if you do not have the adult version.
- Example - if you do not have shiny tyranitar but could offer a shiny larvitar, I will take it.
