# Pvp Trade List

> Welcome, fellow PvPer. Here is a list of Pokemon I am looking for at low friendship trades. For each category, each row is sorted in order of preference from most preferred to least preferred; although I am happy with anything on the list. Each row has 6 catgories: image of the wanted Pokemon, name of the pokemon, pokedex #, wether or not I have it dexed, desired legacy movesets, and additional notes. If you have any questions or find a mistake, feel free to reach out to me.
